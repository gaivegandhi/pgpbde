Pseudo Code:
------------

MAP_TOTAL_VEG_AND_NON_VEG_PIZZA_SOLD (Key, Value)

START

LS = Split (Value, “\t”)

IS_VEG = LS[12]

ORDER_EVENT = LS[11]

IF ( IS_VEG == “Y”  AND ORDER_EVENT == “Delivered” )

Write (Veg_Pizza_Sold, 1)

ELSE IF (IS_VEG == “N” AND ORDER_EVENT == “Delivered” )

Write (Non­Veg_Pizza_Sold, 1)

ENDMAP


REDUCE_TOTAL_VEG_AND_NON_VEG_PIZZA_SOLD (Key, ValueList)

START

Count = 0

FOR i = 1 To ValueList.length

Count = Count + 1

Write (Key, Count)

END


Explanation For Map:
--------------------

01. A transaction record is stored in Value. 

02. The Split function extracts 12 values out of the record using a tab delimiter and stores these values in a List LS.

03. The information whether a Pizza is Veg or Non­Veg is available at LS[12]. 

04. The information on ORDER_EVENT is available at LS[11].

05. If IS_VEG is Y and ORDER_EVENT is Delivered then the output is written using a Write function. Veg_Pizza_Sold is the Key and 1 is the Value.

06. If IS_VEG is N and ORDER_EVENT is Delivered then the output is written using a Write function. Non­Veg_Pizza_Sold is the Key and 1 is the Value.

07. It is presumed that the ORDER_EVENT could have multiple values like Placed, Initiated, On The Way, Cancelled And Delivered. 

08. The Delivered status will ensure that the Pizza is sold as a Delivered status cannot be changed to Cancelled. 

09. At all other stages, the ORDER_EVENT could be changed to Cancelled.

10. The output of this MAP will be aggregated and provided as input to REDUCE. 

11. For example, the output of the MAP would be (Veg_Pizza_Sold, 1), (Veg_Pizza_Sold, 1),(Veg_Pizza_Sold, 1), (Non­Veg_Pizza_Sold, 1).

12. The aggregated result will be (Veg_Pizza_Sold, {1,1,1}) and (Non­Veg_Pizza_Sold, {1})


Explanation For Reduce:
-----------------------

01. The input to the REDUCE would be the aggregated output of the MAP. For example, (Veg_Pizza_Sold, {1,1,1}) and (Non­Veg_Pizza_Sold, {1})

02. The REDUCE will loop through the ValueList and will count the total items in the list.

03. The output of the REDUCE will be Key and Count. For example, (Veg_Pizza_Sold, 3) and (Non­Veg_Pizza_Sold, 1)
