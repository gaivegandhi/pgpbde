Explanation:
------------

01. A transaction record is stored in Value. 

02. The Split function extracts 12 values out of the record using a tab delimiter and stores these values in a List LS.

03. The information whether a Pizza is Veg or Non-Veg is available at LS[12]. 

04. The information on ORDER_EVENT is available at LS[11].

05. 02 global counter variables VEG_PIZZA_SOLD and NON-VEG_PIZZA_SOLD are created.

06. The VEG_PIZZA_SOLD global counter variable is inremented if IS_VEG is Y and ORDER_EVENT is Delivered.

07. The NON-VEG_PIZZA_SOLD global counter variable is inremented if IS_VEG is N and ORDER_EVENT is Delivered.

08. It is presumed that the ORDER_EVENT could have multiple values like Placed, Initiated, On The Way, Cancelled And Delivered. 

09. The Delivered status will ensure that the Pizza is sold as a Delivered status cannot be changed to Cancelled. 

10. At all other stages, the ORDER_EVENT could be changed to Cancelled.
