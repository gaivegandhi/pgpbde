Pseudo Code:
------------

MAP_TOTAL_CHEESE_BURST_PIZZA_LESS_THAN_RS_500 (Key, Value)

START

LS = Split (Value, “\t”)

IS_CHEESE_BURST = LS[6]

PRICE = LS[9]

IF ( IS_CHEESE_BURST == “Y”  AND  PRICE  < 500)

getCounter(“CHEESE_BURST_LESS_THAN_500”).incrementBy(1)

END


Explanation:
------------     

01. A transaction record is stored in Value. 

02. The Split function extracts 12 values out of the record using a tab delimiter and stores these values in a List LS.

03. The information whether a Pizza is Cheese Burst or Not is available at LS[6].

04. The information regarding the Price of a Pizza is available at LS[9].

05. A global counter variable CHEESE_BURST_LESS_THAN_500 is created.

06. The CHEESE_BURST_LESS_THAN_500 global counter variable is inremented if IS_CHEESE_BURST is Y and PRICE is less than 500.

07. Unlike other algorithms, we have not considered the ORDER_EVENT as the question does not specifically talk about Sold Pizza.
