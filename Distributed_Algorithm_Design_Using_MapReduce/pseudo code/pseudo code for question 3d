Pseudo Code:
------------

MAP_TOTAL_SMALL_CHEESE_BURST_PIZZA_SOLD (Key, Value)

START

LS = Split (Value, “\t”)

IS_CHEESE_BURST = LS[6]

SIZE = LS[7]

ORDER_EVENT = LS[11]

IF ( IS_CHEESE_BURST == “Y”  AND  SIZE == “S” AND

ORDER_EVENT == ”Delivered” )

getCounter(“SMALL_CHEESE_BURST_SOLD”).incrementBy(1)

END


Explanation:
------------

01. A transaction record is stored in Value. 

02. The Split function extracts 12 values out of the record using a tab delimiter and stores these values in a List LS.

03. The information whether a Pizza is Cheese Burst or Not is available at LS[6].

04. The information regarding the Size of the Pizza is available at LS[7]. 

05. It is presumed that there are 04 Sizes of Pizza. S is Small, R is Regular, M is Medium and L is Large.

06. The information on ORDER_EVENT is available at LS[11].

07. A global counter variable SMALL_CHEESE_BURST_SOLD is created.

08. The SMALL_CHEESE_BURST_SOLD global counter variable is inremented if IS_CHEESE_BURST is Y, SIZE is S and ORDER_EVENT is Delivered.

09. It is presumed that the ORDER_EVENT could have multiple values like Placed, Initiated, On The Way, Cancelled And Delivered. 

10. The Delivered status will ensure that the Pizza is sold as a Delivered status cannot be changed to Cancelled. 

11. At all other stages, the ORDER_EVENT could be changed to Cancelled.
