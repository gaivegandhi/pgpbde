Explanation:
------------

01. A transaction record is stored in Value. 

02. The Split function extracts 12 values out of the record using a tab delimiter and stores these values in a List LS.
	  
03. The information regarding the Size of the Pizza is available at LS[7]. 

04. It is presumed that there are 04 Sizes of Pizza. S is Small, R is Regular, M is Medium and L is Large.

05. The information on ORDER_EVENT is available at LS[11].

06. 04 global counter variables SMALL_PIZZA_SOLD, REGULAR_PIZZA_SOLD, MEDIUM_PIZZA_SOLD and LARGE_PIZZA_SOLD are created.

07. The SMALL_PIZZA_SOLD global counter variable is inremented if the SIZE is S and ORDER_EVENT is Delivered.

08. The REGULAR_PIZZA_SOLD global counter variable is inremented if the SIZE is R and ORDER_EVENT is Delivered.

09. The MEDIUM_PIZZA_SOLD global counter variable is inremented if the SIZE is M and ORDER_EVENT is Delivered.

10. The LARGE_PIZZA_SOLD global counter variable is inremented if the SIZE is L and ORDER_EVENT is Delivered.

11. It is presumed that the ORDER_EVENT could have multiple values like Placed, Initiated, On The Way, Cancelled And Delivered. 

12. The Delivered status will ensure that the Pizza is sold as a Delivered status cannot be changed to Cancelled. 

13. At all other stages, the ORDER_EVENT could be changed to Cancelled.
