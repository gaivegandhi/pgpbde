Pseudo Code:
------------

MAP_TOTAL_CHEESE_BURST_PIZZA_SOLD (Key, Value)

START

LS = Split (Value, “\t”)

IS_CHEESE_BURST = LS[6]

ORDER_EVENT = LS[11]

IF ( IS_CHEESE_BURST == “Y” AND ORDER_EVENT == “Delivered” )

getCounter(“CHEESE_BURST_PIZZA_SOLD”).incrementBy(1)

END


Explanation:
------------
	 
01. A transaction record is stored in Value. 

02. The Split function extracts 12 values out of the record using a tab delimiter and stores these values in a List LS.

03. The information whether a Pizza is Cheese Burst or Not is available at LS[6].

04. The information on ORDER_EVENT is available at LS[11].

05. A global counter variable CHEESE_BURST_PIZZA_SOLD is created.

06. The CHEESE_BURST_PIZZA_SOLD global counter variable is inremented if IS_CHEESE_BURST is Y and ORDER_EVENT is Delivered.

07. It is presumed that the ORDER_EVENT could have multiple values like Placed, Initiated, On The Way, Cancelled And Delivered. 

08. The Delivered status will ensure that the Pizza is sold as a Delivered status cannot be changed to Cancelled. 

09. At all other stages, the ORDER_EVENT could be changed to Cancelled.
