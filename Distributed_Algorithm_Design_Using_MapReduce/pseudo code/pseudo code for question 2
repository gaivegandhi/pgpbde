Pseudo Code:
------------

MAP_EXTRACT_OS_VERSION_AND_PLATFORM (Key, Value)

START

LS = Split (Value, “\t”)

USER_AGENT = LS[4]

NEW_LS = Split (USER_AGENT,”:”)

PLATFORM = NEW_LS[1]

OS_VERSION = NEW_LS[2]

Write (USER_AGENT, {PLATFORM, OS_VERSION})

END


Explanation:
------------

01. A transaction record is stored in Value. 

02. The Split function extracts 12 values out of the record using a tab delimiter and stores these values in a List LS.

03. The value for USER_AGENT is available at LS[4].

04. The Split function is used with “:” as delimiter to extract Platform and OS Version information.

05. The record is written using a Write function with USER_AGENT as Key and {PLATFORM, OS_VERSION} as ValueList.
